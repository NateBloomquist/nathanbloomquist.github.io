    "text": "Over the past several years, sports betting has become a socially accepted practice while dynasties such as the Kansas City Chiefs have simultaneously dominated the NFL. Because of this, whenever a questionable penalty is called in favor of a dominant team, there have been outcries from fans complaining about officiating bias and unfair officiating. This begs the question, do the better teams in the NFL have an unfair advantage in games when it comes to officiating?\nWell, lets take a look at some data using the Chiefs as an example since they are the team who is mentioned the most in this discussion. nflverse has play-by-play data for each teams season dating back to 1999. To see if there is a bias towards certain teams, we can take the data starting in 2020 (when the Chiefs dynasty began) until present day and see if there is a discrepancy between the amount of penalties a team is getting versus the amount their opponents are getting.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npbp &lt;- load_pbp(2020:2024)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(penalty_team)) |&gt;\n  count(penalty_team, name = \"team_penalties\") |&gt;\n  rename(team = penalty_team) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    pbp |&gt;\n      filter(!is.na(penalty_team)) |&gt;\n      mutate(opponent = ifelse(penalty_team == posteam, defteam, posteam)) |&gt;\n      count(opponent, name = \"opp_penalties\") |&gt;\n      rename(team = opponent),\n    by = \"team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(penalty_diff = opp_penalties - team_penalties)\n\nggplot(penalty_data, aes(y = reorder(team, penalty_diff))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = team_penalties, xend = opp_penalties, yend = team), \n               color = \"gray\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = team_penalties), color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = opp_penalties), color = \"green\", size = 3) +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team, x = (team_penalties + opp_penalties) / 2), \n                 width = 0.04, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(data = penalty_data |&gt; filter(team == \"KC\"),\n             aes(x = (team_penalties + opp_penalties) / 2),\n             shape = 21, size = 12, stroke = 2, color = \"blue\", fill = NA) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which NFL Teams Benefit Most from Penalties?\",\n    subtitle = \"Red = Team Penalties | Green = Opponent Penalties\",\n    x = \"Total Penalties\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse 2020-2024| By Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, color = \"gray\"),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the chart shows is that while the Chiefs commit less penalties than their opponents, it is not by a wide enough margin to say that they have an unfair advantage. Especially when teams such as the Falcons, the Vikings, and the Raiders all have a much larger difference.\nThe next logical argument would be what about the kind of penalty? When people are complaining about officiating regarding the Chiefs, it often has to do with soft roughing the passer calls or invisible pass interference penalties. We have all seen Patrick Mahomes flop or have an interception overturned due to a pass interference, so do they benefit from these types of high yardage calls more than other teams?\n\n\nCode\nhigh_impact &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(penalty_type %in% c(\"Roughing the Passer\", \"Defensive Pass Interference\")) |&gt;\n  select(posteam, defteam, penalty_type)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  high_impact |&gt; count(posteam, penalty_type, name = \"count\") |&gt; rename(team = posteam),\n  high_impact |&gt; count(defteam, penalty_type, name = \"count\") |&gt; rename(team = defteam) |&gt; mutate(count = -count)\n)\n\npenalty_data &lt;- penalty_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    team = factor(team, levels = penalty_data |&gt; group_by(team) |&gt; summarise(net = sum(count)) |&gt; arrange(net) |&gt; pull(team)),\n    penalty_display = ifelse(team == \"KC\", penalty_type, paste0(penalty_type, \" (Other)\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(penalty_data, aes(x = team, y = count, fill = penalty_display)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Roughing the Passer\" = \"yellow\",\n      \"Defensive Pass Interference\" = \"red\",\n      \"Roughing the Passer (Other)\" = \"gray70\",\n      \"Defensive Pass Interference (Other)\" = \"gray85\"\n    ),\n    name = \"Penalty Type\",\n    breaks = c(\"Roughing the Passer\", \"Defensive Pass Interference\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Do the Chiefs get the High Impact flags everyone complains about?\",\n    subtitle = \"Left = Penalties Committed, Right = Benefited from Opponent Penalties\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Number of Penalties\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse 2020-2024 | By Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the data seems to show the opposite of what most NFL fans would like to see. The Chiefs had less roughing the passer calls called against their opponents than a large amount of the league, which helps to disprove the rumor that referees give special treatment to Mahomes. Over the past 5 seasons, the Chiefs have also been one of the most penalized teams when it comes to defensive pass interference, which helps to further disprove that referees favor better teams.\nIf their opponents don’t get more penalties called against them and they don`t benefit from the penalties that most people complain about, the last argument that could be made would be when do those penalties happen. Do the Chiefs get bailed out by penalties when it matters the most?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\npbp &lt;- load_pbp(2020:2024)\n\npenalties &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(\n    !is.na(penalty_team),\n    (qtr == 4 & abs(score_differential) &lt;= 8) |\n    (qtr == 2 & game_seconds_remaining &lt;= 120 & abs(score_differential) &lt;= 8) |\n    (qtr == 4 & down %in% c(3, 4)) |\n    (yardline_100 &lt;= 20)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(team = posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(net_penalty_diff = sum(penalty_team == defteam) - sum(penalty_team == posteam))\n\nwins &lt;- pbp |&gt;\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\") |&gt;\n  distinct(game_id, home_team, away_team, result) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(c(home_team, away_team), values_to = \"team\") |&gt;\n  mutate(win = (name == \"home_team\" & result &gt; 0) | (name == \"away_team\" & result &lt; 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(team) |&gt;\n  summarize(win_pct = mean(win))\n\nchiefs_data &lt;- penalties |&gt;\n  inner_join(wins, by = \"team\") |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"KC\")\n\npenalties |&gt;\n  inner_join(wins, by = \"team\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(win_pct, net_penalty_diff)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0.32, y = 2, label = \"No net advantage\", \n           color = \"gray\", size = 3, fontface = \"italic\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0.65, y = -6, label = \"Trend line (95% CI)\", \n           color = \"red\", size = 3, fontface = \"italic\") +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = 0.05, alpha = 0.8) +\n  # Add circle around Chiefs\n  annotate(\"point\", x = chiefs_data$win_pct, y = chiefs_data$net_penalty_diff,\n           size = 15, shape = 21, color = \"blue\", stroke = 2.5, fill = NA) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Do the Chiefs Get Bailed Out When it Matters Most?\",\n    subtitle = \"Penalties in 4th quarter, close games, red zone plays, and critical downs vs Win %\",\n    x = \"Win Percentage (2020-2024)\",\n    y = \"Penalty Advantage\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflverse 2020-2024 | Nate Bloomquist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows that when it matters the most (red-zone plays, close games, etc.) and shows that the Chiefs have the second highest penalty advantage in the NFL from 2020-2024 and the highest win percentage to go with it. However, the penalty advantage isn’t incredibly outrageous. Some may argue that even this slight advantage points towards an unfair advantage, but I view it differently. The way that I see it, the Chiefs are a very good team and if they are given an opportunity, such as a bad penalty call, they will take advantage of it.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the reason people believe that the Chiefs receive bias officiating from Referees is because they are a good team who is given more prime time games and media attention. With this increased attention, the bad calls that are prevalent around the entire NFL are put on full display."
